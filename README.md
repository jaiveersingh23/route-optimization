# Route Optimization with AI and Heuristic Algorithms

This project focuses on optimizing delivery routes using a variety of algorithms, including heuristic methods and AI-based approaches. By comparing Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization, Nearest Neighbor Heuristic, and Reinforcement Learning, we aim to find the most efficient routing strategies for delivery systems. The project also includes a visualization component for comparing algorithm performance.

## 📚 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Delivery locations are fetched from CSV files.
2. **Preprocessing**: Distance matrices are generated using APIs (Google Maps or OpenStreetMap).
3. **Algorithm Design**: 
   - Reinforcement Learning is trained with a neural network for policy optimization.
   - Heuristic methods use iterative and probabilistic approaches for optimization.
4. **Evaluation**: Metrics such as total distance, execution time, and scalability are used to evaluate performance.
5. **Visualization**: Results are visualized using scatter plots, bar charts, and route maps.
